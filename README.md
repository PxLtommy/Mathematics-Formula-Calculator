# Maths All-in-One Calculator

This project aims to provide teachers with a fully-functioning mathematical calculator, that primarily
focuses on solving fully-fledged functions for them. For example, instead of having to manually 
remember and enter entire formulas for lets say, figuring out the blood-alcohol-content for a textbook question. The user
can simply type into the program that they want to solve the BAC. The program will then ask for the
required information, calculate it, then output it to the teacher in miliseconds.

The documentation for this program can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xr_103din2yMFHK86hl7IhhrNhKDLXdYOjA_TWUBdsQ/edit?usp=sharing)

F.A.Q:

Why should I use your program over a website?

- Typically with math calculation websites, they only have 1 or 2 formulas for a certain topic. Meaning if you want 
  to solve with the sine rule, and then use cosine, you will need 2 different websites. My program has every formula
  all-in-one. And if it doesn't, then the desired formula can be requested using the #Pull-requests tab via github.
  
How do I request a feature/module?

- Features can be requested by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/ThomasAdnum/Maths-All-in-One-Calculator/issues/new) on this github repo, and adding the label 'enchancement'. You can then describe what you want added to the program
  
How do I download the GUI concept?

- The GUI is available for download under the 'Releases' tab in the latest version.
  
Is your storyboard on Adobe XD annotated?

- Yes it is. I used a sticky note plugin on there, so if they do not show, then that plugin needs to be downloaded.
